Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.


Note:
A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?



```python
class Solution:
  def __init__(self):
  def findBadNode(self, root):
  def recoverTree(self, root):
```
