Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.


```python
class Solution(object):
  def mergeTwoLists(self, l1, l2):
    """
    :type l1: ListNode
    :type l2: ListNode
    :rtype: ListNode
    """
```
