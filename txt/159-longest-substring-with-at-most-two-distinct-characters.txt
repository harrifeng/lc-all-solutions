Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most 2 distinct characters.



For example,

Given s = “eceba”,



T is "ece" which its length is 3.



```python
class Solution(object):
  def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s):
    """
    :type s: str
    :rtype: int
    """
  def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s, k):
    """
    :type s: str
    :type k: int
    :rtype: int
    """
```
