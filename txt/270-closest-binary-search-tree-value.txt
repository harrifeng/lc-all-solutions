Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Note:

Given target value is a floating point.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.



```python
class Solution(object):
  def closestValue(self, p, target):
    """
    :type root: TreeNode
    :type target: float
    :rtype: int
    """
```
