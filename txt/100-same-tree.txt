Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.


Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.



```python
class Solution(object):
  def isSameTree(self, p, q):
    """
    :type p: TreeNode
    :type q: TreeNode
    :rtype: bool
    """
```
