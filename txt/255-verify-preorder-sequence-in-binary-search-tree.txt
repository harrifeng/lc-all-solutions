Given an array of numbers, verify whether it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.

You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.

Follow up:
Could you do it using only constant space complexity?


```python
class Solution(object):
  def verifyPreorder(self, preorder):
    """
    :type preorder: List[int]
    :rtype: bool
    """
```
